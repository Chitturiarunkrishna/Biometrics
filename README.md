# Fingerprint-based-onspot-cashless-credit-system-for-cabs
In todayâ€™s world everything is digitalizing with the increase in the technology. We should also move with the technology. In our college we take cabs to move from one place to other and we still use money for paying the fare for it, while paying the fare we have a problem that we do not have the exact change to pay for it, if we have a payment system which does not required to carry money and it is more convenient. We propose a biometric system in the cabs for making the cabs to run cashless. 
We place the biometric system in the cab for the verification and identification of the students. The students enrol their biometric who are willing to use cabs; they pay the fare while registering so they can use the cabs just by giving their biometric. This system helps use the cabs conveniently without worry of not charring cash or not having the change for it.
